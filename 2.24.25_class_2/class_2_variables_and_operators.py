# You are given a triangle with a side of 4, base of 6, and a side of 3. Create
a brief python script that will determine the perimeter of the triangle. Comment your code

1. Print the perimeter
2. Using boolean operators is side #1 greater than the base?
3. Using boolean operators is side #2 less than the base?
4. Using boolean operators is base larger than or equal to side #1?

Write some code that converts fahrenheit to celsius.

To convert fahrenheit to celsius, subtract 32, then multiply by 5/9.

C = (F - 32) * 5/9
